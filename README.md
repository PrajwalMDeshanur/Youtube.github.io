# Introduction
Implementation of efficient Datastructure and Algorithm in enhancing of students experience.
The advent of online education has changed the entire conventional process of learning. It made the students learn anything sitting at any corner across the country. Pandemic brought coaching institutions to teach students in the online domain. This brought great flexibility to the learning process and shortened the learning gap between the students.Since the pandemic, many online learning platforms have opened and offer various online courses from classes 6 to 12, IIT-JEE, NEET, etc.It eases the process of learning & understanding.

The sector that molds future generations is the education sector. By 2025, it is expected to grow to a $7 trillion worldwide business. The COVID-19 pandemic’s disruption sparked the growth of the ed-tech industry, which makes use of digital resources to deliver inclusive, interesting, and customized education. About $4 billion in private investment has been made in India’s ed-tech sector during the last five years. In the next ten years, it is expected to grow to be a $30 billion sector that supports and enhances traditional classroom teaching methods.
By using advanced algorithmic techniques and innovative data structures, this project aims to propose solutions to real-world business challenges. From giving a better approach for doubts and queries of students to improvision recommendation of courses.
