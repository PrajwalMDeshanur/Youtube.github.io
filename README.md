# Introduction
Implementation of efficient Datastructure and Algorithm in enhancing of students experience.
The advent of online education has changed the entire conventional process of learning. It made the students learn anything sitting at any corner across the country. Pandemic brought coaching institutions to teach students in the online domain. This brought great flexibility to the learning process and shortened the learning gap between the students.Since the pandemic, many online learning platforms have opened and offer various online courses from classes 6 to 12, IIT-JEE, NEET, etc.It eases the process of learning & understanding.

PhysicsWallah, Indiaâ€™s newest edtech unicorn, expects its FY23 revenue to exceed Rs 1,200 crore, driven by high demand for its courses. Contrary to the perceived slowdown in online learning, the company has seen a 2-2.5x growth in online course subscriptions this year. While marketing expenses have increased, PhysicsWallah aims to close the year with a 40-45% EBITDA margin. The company has already reached Rs 350 crore in revenue in the first quarter, with projections of Rs 1,000-1,200 crore by year-end.
