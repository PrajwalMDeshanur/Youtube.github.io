# Introduction
Implementation of efficient Datastructure and Algorithm in enhancing of Youtube's experience.
In today's digital age, online platforms like YouTube have become an integral part of our daily lives, revolutionizing how we consume and interact with content. As the user experience on platforms like YouTube continues to evolve.With DSA knowlege which has been delivered in Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS) course, applying the concept to enhance performance, optimizing algorithms, and improving data structures to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience.

By using advanced algorithmic techniques and innovative data structures, this project aims to propose solutions to real-world business challenges. From refining search engine algorithms to improvision recommendation of videos and shorts.

This portfolio delves into the core principles of algorithm design and data structure optimization, specifically tailored to address challenges and opportunities within YouTube's ecosystem. This project is part of the course "Algorithm Problem Solving," which focuses on applying algorithmic thinking and problem-solving strategies to real-world scenarios.

# Why Portfolio
A portfolio is neccesary to showcase to understand the application of Data structure and algorithm,system design and analysis of real-world problems. It enables to know the current market needs, trends and current innovation in the Youtube domain.
