# Introduction
Implementation of efficient Datastructure and Algorithm in enhancing of students experience.
The advent of online education has changed the entire conventional process of learning. It made the students learn anything sitting at any corner across the country. Pandemic brought coaching institutions to teach students in the online domain. This brought great flexibility to the learning process and shortened the learning gap between the students.Since the pandemic, many online learning platforms have opened and offer various online courses from classes 6 to 12, IIT-JEE, NEET, etc.It eases the process of learning & understanding.

The sector that molds future generations is the education sector. By 2025, it is expected to grow to a $7 trillion worldwide business. The COVID-19 pandemic’s disruption sparked the growth of the ed-tech industry, which makes use of digital resources to deliver inclusive, interesting, and customized education. About $4 billion in private investment has been made in India’s ed-tech sector during the last five years. In the next ten years, it is expected to grow to be a $30 billion sector that supports and enhances traditional classroom teaching methods.
By using advanced algorithmic techniques and innovative data structures, this project aims to propose solutions to real-world business challenges. From giving a better approach for doubts and queries of students to improvision recommendation of courses.


# Why Portfolio
The portfolio bridges academic concepts with practical applications, showcasing the ability to apply theoretical knowledge from DSA and APS courses to real-world challenges.It highlights not only the capability to solve practical problems but also a commitment to advancing the quality and effectiveness of the services, making it a valuable asset for educational innovation and professional growth in the education sector.Enhancing features such as personalized learning pathways, content recommendations, and performance analytics can significantly improve student engagement and satisfaction. 

# Objectives
**1.** Applying theoretical concepts from Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS) course to practical, real-world problems within the PW platform. 

**2.** Addressing specific business challenges faced by PW through the application of algorithmic problem solving.

**3.** Improving data processing and analytics to provide valuable insights to PW's users for recommendation of courses.

**4.** Introduction of effective and optimal algorithms to already existing algorithm.

# Business Use Cases

**1. Search Completion or suggestion in PW App**

**Algorithms:** Trie and InvertedIndexed

**Use Case.**
The app aims to deliver real-time search suggestions as students input their queries. These suggestions include relevant course names, teacher names, and specific topics, considering the user’s preferences, past interactions, and current academic trends. By proactively anticipating student needs and providing precise suggestions, Physics Wallah can streamline the search process, aiding in quick decision-making and enhancing student satisfaction. This feature is especially crucial during peak study times when students expect swift and efficient access to their desired courses and teachers.

**Challengs:**
The main challenge lies in efficiently managing a vast and continuously evolving database of courses, teachers, and educational content. Additionally, the system must handle a wide range of user queries, including typos, abbreviations, and varying degrees of specificity. Another critical challenge is balancing the breadth of suggestions with their relevance to the student’s preferences and academic needs.

**Market Benifts:**
An effective live search feature can significantly boost user engagement and satisfaction. By reducing the time and effort required to find the right courses or teachers, Physics Wallah can encourage more frequent usage and foster increased student loyalty. The personalized nature of the suggestions may also lead to the exploration of new courses and topics, enriching the overall learning experience and distinguishing Physics Wallah from its competitors.Use tries for substring matching and auto-suggestions as the user types. Use the inverted index for broader keyword searches.

**Time Complexity (Search):** O(L), where L is the length of the query.
**Space Complexity:** O(N*L), where N is the number of words and L is the average word length.

**2. Ranked Search Results for Physics Wallah App**
**Algorithms:** Max-Heap (Priority Queue) Algorithm
**Use Case.**
To enhance student satisfaction and facilitate course selection, Physics Wallah needs to present search results in an order that aligns with student preferences and expectations. This involves developing a sophisticated ranking algorithm that considers multiple factors, including course ratings, the number of students enrolled, and teacher ratings. By tailoring the search results to individual students, Physics Wallah can ensure that the most relevant and appealing options are displayed prominently, increasing the likelihood of course enrollment.

**Challengs:**
The primary challenge is creating a ranking algorithm that accurately reflects student preferences and priorities. This requires collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data, such as past enrollments, search history, and interactions with the app. The algorithm also needs to adapt to real-time changes, such as course availability or new teacher ratings.

**Market Benifts:**
A well-optimized search ranking algorithm can significantly impact Physics Wallah's user engagement and retention. By showcasing the most relevant and high-quality courses to students, the platform can increase enrollment rates, improve student satisfaction, and foster long-term loyalty.

Time Complexity (Search): O(nlogn)
Space Complexity: O(n)
