# Introduction
Implementation of efficient Datastructure and Algorithm in enhancing of students experience.
The advent of online education has changed the entire conventional process of learning. It made the students learn anything sitting at any corner across the country. Pandemic brought coaching institutions to teach students in the online domain. This brought great flexibility to the learning process and shortened the learning gap between the students.

By using advanced algorithmic techniques and innovative data structures, this project aims to propose solutions to real-world business challenges. From refining search engine algorithms to improvision recommendation of videos and shorts.

This portfolio delves into the core principles of algorithm design and data structure optimization, specifically tailored to address challenges and opportunities within YouTube's ecosystem. This project is part of the course "Algorithm Problem Solving," which focuses on applying algorithmic thinking and problem-solving strategies to real-world scenarios.

# Why Portfolio
A portfolio is neccesary to showcase to understand the application of Data structure and algorithm,system design and analysis of real-world problems. It enables to know the current market needs, trends and current innovation in the Youtube domain.
